# dropit

A 2d physics-based game of arranging bouncy surfaces and dropping balls such that certain constraints are satified (to score points).

## Prebuilt Objects

These objects are targets that are preplaced to form the level's puzzel.

### Bidirectional gate

A gate object which permits the ball to pass in both directions causing the gate to swing both clockwise and counter clockwise.

### Unidirectional gate

A gate object which is impermeable in one direction but allows the ball to pass in the other direction.

### Bidirectional Basket

An oriented pair of pegs through which the ball must pass in either direction.

### Unidirectional Basket

An oriented pair of pegs through which the ball must pass in a specified direction. Should the ball attempt to pass in the wrong direction, the basket is impermeable.
